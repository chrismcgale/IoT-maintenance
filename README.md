# IoTMaintenance

## Motive ##
The purpose of this project is to predict the time until an internet of things (IoT) device will require maintenance or replacement so this can be prepared in advance.
I'll be using the 'Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set' from NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository (http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/).

## The Data ##
The data schema is as follows

The original data source has input data is spread across 3 files "train_FD001.txt", "test_FD001.txt", and "RUL_FD001.txt". 
The ith line of the "RUL" data represents the number of cycles remaining for the test device with id i. We'll have to join these tables when the time comes.
